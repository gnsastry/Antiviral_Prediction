# Antiviral_Prediction
Seven Machine Learning algorithms Random Forest, XGBoost, Support Vector Machine, KNN, Decision Tree, MLP Classifier and Logistic Regression were benchmarked on a set of 2358 antiviral compounds compiled from the CAS COVID-19 antiviral SAR dataset. RF and XGBoost performed best in all the feature selection methods with maximum predictive accuracy.
